## Rules for fluent API

First: these are not Builders. The Builder pattern assumes that calling "build()" creates a new instance every time. 
The Fluent-helpers do not create new instances, they just wrap a concrete final component and allow fluent access to 
its setters.

### How it is done

- a fluent wrapper is created for every Vaadin Component
- every constructor of Component "Bar" can be accessed via static method FluentBar.bar(....)
- every "setFoo()" method can be accessed via "foo()" (no "with...")
- every "addFoo(Foo foo)" method can be accessed via vararg "addFoo(Foo... foos)", so many items can be added at once
- methods concerning lifecycle and composition (setParent, setCompositionRoot) must not be exposed.
- boolean setters (setEnabled()) become enabled(boolean) but might be flanked by enable() and disable() when applicable.
